# Functional validation

> Isomorphic validation using function composition

## Introduction

This is a package for validating input in requests using functional composition.
It runs in both browsers and Node.js, and is well-suited for sharing validations
between both of these environments.

Install it with `yarn add @cjhowe7/validation` or, if you use npm, with
`npm i --save @cjhowe7/validation`.
